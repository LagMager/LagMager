- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LagMager
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Game Development, Software and Systems Engineering and Astronomy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, looking forward to learn JavaScript.
- ðŸ’» I have learned C++, Python, Lua and GDScript. Although I'm more like a Jack of all trades in all of them.

Beyond tech, I like to compose music, play chess and read books. 

Some of the projects I'm working on right now are:
- Recoil Roboto (2D Bullet Hell Platformer with Metroidvania elements)
- Creating a NES emulator. 

I have some serious trouble getting started wit things but once I work on them I don't stop until its finished ðŸ”¥
